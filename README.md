**A practical guide to writing readable and maintainable SQL queries using its design patterns**

## What is this book about?
SQL has been the de facto standard when interacting with databases for decades and shows no signs of going away. Through the years, report developers or data wranglers have had to learn SQL on the fly to meet the business needs, so if you are someone who needs to write queries, SQL Query Design and Pattern Best Practices is for you.
This book will guide you through making efficient SQL queries by reducing set sizes for effective results. You’ll learn how to format your results to make them easier to consume at their destination. From there, the book will take you through solving complex business problems using more advanced techniques, such as common table expressions and window functions, and advance to uncovering issues resulting from security in the underlying dataset. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll have a foundation for building queries and be ready to shift focus to using tools, such as query plans and indexes, to optimize those queries. The book will go over the modern data estate, which includes data lakes and JSON data, and wrap up with a brief on how to use Jupyter notebooks in your SQL journey.
By the end of this SQL book, you’ll be able to make efficient SQL queries that will improve your report writing and the overall SQL experience.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build efficient queries by reducing the data being returned
* Manipulate your data and format it for easier consumption
* Form common table expressions and window functions to solve complex business issues
* Understand the impact of SQL security on your results
* Understand and use query plans to optimize your queries
* Understand the impact of indexes on your query performance and design
* Work with data lake data and JSON in SQL queries
* Organize your queries using Jupyter notebooks
